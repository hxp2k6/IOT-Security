Problem statement:
•	Smart homes is an application of IoT, which allows you to remotely control home appliances and devices such as Garage doors, television set, thermostat etc.
•	These devices are able to communicate with each other and send vital information for better management of home.
•	Companies producing smart devices for home have been oblivious to the consequences of an unsecure communication between the devices as well the remote controlling device.
•	We plan to secure the intercommunication between the devices and with the internet, so that humans with malicious intent do not misuse the data or the device.

 
Proposed Solution:
•	M2M communication: Encrypt the transmission data using an algorithm that consumes less power for encryption and decryption to prevent eavesdroppers from accessing private data.

•	Securing Machine to web communication to prevent unauthorized access to the machine.

•	Securing Machine to Remote device communication..
	

Implementation:
Platform: Microsoft Windows 10

Programming language: Java

Components: Not definitive at present.

Hardware requirements: An android based device, running on at least Android 5.0 
Timeline:
Mid-October - Provide the research details of the algorithms.
Mid-October - Mid November - Develop the applications and provide code commits for the application
Mid-November - December - Commit entire project and start testing.
